## Description
The purpose of building this application was to demonstrate `OOP (Object Oriented Programming)` and show how different classes function. There are three different types of vehicles to choose from: `car`, `truck`, or `motorbike`. This application does show the difference with dividing the interface and objects into their own respective areas.
